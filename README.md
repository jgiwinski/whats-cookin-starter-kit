# What's Cookin'

GitHub Page: [What's Cookin'](https://jgiwinski.github.io/whats-cookin-starter-kit/)

What's Cookin' is a program that allows a user to view a list of recipes. On page load the user is able to view an image of the recipe and the associated tags. At the top of the page, in the navigation bar, the user can select buttons and toggle between three different views: All Recipes, Favorite Recipes, and their Pantry.

On the left side of the page there is a list of tags the user can select and use to filter the recipes displayed on the page. Select the desired tags and then hit the submit button to regenerate the recipe view. 

There are two search bars towards the top of the page. The user can decide if they would like to search by the name of the recipe or by the ingredients used to make the recipe. 


If a user is interested in a recipe they can select it by double clicking on the recipe card. A new recipe card will popup with all the details for the selected recipe: title, instructions, ingredients, and the cost to make the entire recipe.

Once the user finds a recipe they are interested in cooking they have the option to add it to their favorite recipes list, by clicking the image once. The user can then move over to the favorites recipe view and see all of the recipes they have saved. By clicking on a recipe card once in the favorites the user can remove the recipe from their favorites. 

Within the favorite recipes view the user can search by name or ingredient with the search bar. They also have the option to filter by tag. 

In the pantry view the user can view which ingredients they have and what quantity of each.
